# Color Coords

*Color Coords* is a puzzle game built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). This is a remake of a
[similar game](https://github.com/rocketmo/color-coords) that I designed in 2017 with
[Unity](https://unity.com/). The concept of the game remains the same, but this version adds in
several enhancements and allows users to play it in their browser. The goal of this project was for
me to become more familiar with a modern front-end framework, using the practical approach of
building a web application.

## About

The inspiration for *Color Coords* comes from the ice puzzles you encounter in the majority of
Pok√©mon games. In those puzzles, the player would have to navigate a maze, covered in ice tiles,
trying to find the exit.

The concept of *Color Coords* is similar. The objective of each puzzle is to move your player piece
across a grid of tiles, interacting with items along your path in order to color the grid. Find the
shortest path in each puzzle to earn the most points. For more information, view the *How to Play*
section in-game.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view
it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the
console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about
[running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode
and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include
the hashes.
